# Assignment 2 - Group 11 - Code is written in C.

## Problem 1: The Order Indicator

Take input:
- λ (wavelength) in nanometers (nm)
- θ (angle) in degrees
- d (distance between slits) in micrometers (µm)

Calculate:
m = (d × sinθ) / λ

Output:
- If λ is between 380 nm and 750 nm:
  m-th order maxima
- Otherwise:
  Out of the range. Please enter a valid number.

## Problem 2

What should be the ratio of slit width and wavelength so that the first diffraction minimum occurs at 45°?
